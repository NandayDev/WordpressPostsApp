# WordpressPostsApp

A simple POC application using Jetpack Compose, MVVM pattern, Koin and LiveData.

## Architectural choices

The app is quite simple and straightforward. It was converted from an XML-based layout app to **Jetpack Compose**, during YouTube livestreams (you can check them out on my channel).

It uses **MVVM** and the **Repository** pattern, and uses **LiveData**, integrated with Compose.
